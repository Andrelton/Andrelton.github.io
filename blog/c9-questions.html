        I remember when I first discovered StackOverflow. I was amazed that it not only seemed to have answers to many of the questions I had, but it seemed to be an open-door policy for all the brilliant programming minds on the internet. I was amazed that users could simply ask a question and get an answer.

        In reality, it's a little more complicated than that. While there are a lot of users perusing the question boards hoping to be of help, many questions go unanswered. Why? It isn't simply luck. Some questions attract users, and others do not. It's helpful to understand how to write good questions.

        There are several resources that give advice, but perhaps most helpfully, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">StackOverflow has a great one</a>. Between this article and others, many common themes arise: Make the question title informative and truly a question. State how you've tried to answer the question yourself, and if applicable, show how your question is different from other similar questions. Don't just state that something went wrong, show what you expected to happen at a small scale, and show how doing it right will help accomplish your bigger goal. Be short but complete with code samples. Use correct formatting, spelling, and grammar. Include good tags, proof-read, and respond to feedback.
      </p>

        After learning these, I can look back and see how I've done. I've only asked two questions on StackOverflow, and I've been lucky enough to get decent answers. But my questions have been far from perfect. The titles were complete, but a little long. One of them wasn't even a question. I explained that I'd tried other methods of finding an answer, but my questions didn't cite any specific attempts. Yet I had fairly good code examples, I proof-read many times for format and grammar, and I checked back often to follow-up on clarifying questions and feedback.

        While there are many specific pieces of advice for writing good questions, I believe the best may be the most simple. <a href="http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/">Jon Skeet</a> aptly stated:
      </p>

      <p class="quote">
        Once you’ve finished writing your question, read it through. Imagine you were coming to it fresh, with no context other than what’s on the screen. Does it make sense? Is it clear what’s being asked? Is it easy to read and understand? Are there any obvious areas you’d need to ask about before providing an answer? You can usually do this pretty well however stuck you are on the actual question. Just apply common sense.
      </p>

        We can get a long way in any pursuit by simply putting ourself in another person's shoes. In this case, we can ask, "How will other people see my question? Do I make it easy for them to answer?" When seen from this perspective, much of the advice for writing good questions becomes intuitive. There will always be small ways to tinker and improve our form, but in short, good questions invite good answers.
